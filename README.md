# 🐾 Tiny Paw Stars

**Tiny Paw Stars** is a custom-built website created to support my grandmother’s dog breeding business. It's designed to highlight her dogs, provide information to potential adopters, and add a personal, loving touch to the online presence of her kennel.

This project was coded from scratch using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no site builders — just pure, hand-written code with care and pride.

## 💡 Purpose

This website was made to:
- Showcase adorable puppies and their parents 🐶
- Help potential adopters connect with my grandma and learn more about her breeding practices
- Create a warm, trustworthy brand identity online
- Serve as a real-world application of my web development skills
